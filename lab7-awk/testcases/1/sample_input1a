It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying 
commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and 
packages, students, swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks 
and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red 
light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; 
he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records 
of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly 
past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. 
There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. 
He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed 
the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench 
and single lamppost.
